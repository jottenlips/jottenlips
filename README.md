👋 Hey, I am John Franke.

I like functional programming, infrastructure as code, and developing mobile apps. I started my career building iOS apps for music festivals and then got into full-stack R&D and DevOps for startups. I love collaborating on innovative products and learning new technology. Feel free to drop a follow or star if you like anything I've made.
